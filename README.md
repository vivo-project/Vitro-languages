Vitro-languages
===============

Files that enable Vitro (and by extension, VIVO) to operate in languages beyond American English.

Available language files
------------------------

At present, VIVO has been translated into German, Spanish, and Portuguese. You may find the relevant files for each language by searching for files containing _de_DE, _es, and _pt_BR respectively. English uses the prefix _en_US.

Using the language files
------------------------

If the files you want already exist here, you can add them to your VIVO instance by
following the instructions in the VIVO wiki for [Adding a language to VIVO][1].

If the files for your desired language do not exist then you may use the files in this repository as a
starting point for doing the translations yourself. Search for the required files for any of the language prefixes above (e.g. _en_US), copy the files, and rename your new files using the appropriate language code [prefix][2]. Please send a note to [the VIVO Tech group][3]
to find out if someone else is already working on a translation.

If you create a translation, please consider contributing your language files to the VIVO community.
